A Python data structure to encapsulate a machine learning dataset greatly suited for neuroimaging applications (or any other domain), where each sample needs to be uniquely identified with a subject ID (or something similar). Key-level correspondence across data, labels (1 or 2), classnames ('healthy', 'disease') and the related helps maintain data integrity, in addition to easify traceback to original sources from where the features have been originally derived.

This [Pyradigm Example](PyradigmExample.ipynb) notebook illustrates the usage.

Thanks for checking out. Your feedback will be appreciated.
