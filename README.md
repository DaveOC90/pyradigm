# mldataset
A Python class to encapsulate a machine learning dataset based on dictionares.  This class is greatly suited for neuroimaging applications (or any other domain), where each sample needs to be uniquely identified with a subject ID (or something similar). Key-level correspondence across data, labels (1 or 2), classnames ('healthy', 'disease') and the related helps maintain data integrity and as well as enables traceback to original sources from where the features have been derived from.
